# redirector-for-amazon
Firefox WebExtension for automatically redirecting users to their country's Amazon domain.

Sometimes web links to Amazon take you to `amazon.com`, and also not `smile.amazon.co.uk`. This simple extention detects the user's
country and tries to redirect them to the appropriate URL automatically, including the `smile` prefix if desired.
